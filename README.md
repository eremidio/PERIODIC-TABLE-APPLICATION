# PERIODIC-TABLE-APPLICATION
A SIMPLE CHEMISTRY APPLICATION ABOUT THE PERIODIC TABLE OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS. THIS APPLICATION WAS DEVELOPED IN LINUX AND CONSTAINS A VERY SIMPLE CONSOLE LINE INTERFACE. SOME SMALL CHANGES MAY NEED TO BE DONE FOR OTHER PLATFORMS, FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE ESCAPE SEQUENCES MAY NOT WORK WELL IN SOME ENVIROMENTS.

THIS APPLICATION WAS DEVELOPED FOR PEDAGOGICAL PURPORSES AND AS AN EXERCISE FOR A FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE NCURSES LIBRARY.

IN ORDER TO USE THIS APPLICATION, THE COMPILATION MUST LINK THE SOURCE FILES PROVIDED WITH THE NCURSES LIBRARY. FOR MORE INFO ON HOW TO DO THIS SEE THE LINK: https://dev.to/tbhaxor/introduction-to-ncurses-part-1-1bk5
